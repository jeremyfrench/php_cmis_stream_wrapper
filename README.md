#PHP CMIS STREAM WRAPPER
This is a prototype stream wrapper to make use of the [Apache Chemistry CMIS PHP client][http://chemistry.apache.org/php/phpclient.html] enabiling users to use native PHP file commands with a CMIS repo as a file system. 

If it works well and is stable it should be moved to be part of this library
